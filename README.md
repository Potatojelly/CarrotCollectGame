# Carrot Collect Game

Carrot Collect is a simple and fun HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based game. The objective is to collect all the carrots displayed on the screen. However, you must be careful not to click on any bugs that may appear. You also need to beat the clock and collect all carrots before the time runs out!

## Gameplay <a name="gameplay"></a>

The game begins with a screen full of randomly placed carrots and bugs. The player's task is to click on each carrot to collect them while avoiding clicking on bugs. There's also a countdown timer, and the game ends either when the time runs out, or a bug is clicked. Winning the game requires collecting all the carrots within the allotted time without clicking on any bugs.

### Context for the Project

The Carrot Collector game started as a side project. I wanted to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript more in-depth while creating something fun and interactive.

### Objective

It aimed to reinforce my understanding of basic web technologies.

### Challenges and Learning Experiences

Identifying the logic to generate carrots and bugs within a constrained area at the start of each game, and refreshing these elements upon each game restart were the primary challenges. 

This project helped to deepen my basic knowledge and skills in CSS and HTML.
